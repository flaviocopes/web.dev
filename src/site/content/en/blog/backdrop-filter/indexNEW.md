  CSS backdrop-filter was made famous by Apple's design team. It brings
  a background to act as a filter for the contents beneath
  and creates a nice layering effect that keeps beneath elements in context.

Translucency, vibrancy, and blurring are effective ways of creating depth while keeping context of background content. They support a host of use cases such as frosted glass, video overlays, translucent navigation headers, inappropriate image censoring, image loading, and so on. You may recognize these effects from two popular operating systems: [Windows 10](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9RLXARU4--/c_scale,dpr_2.0,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/trgz8yivyyqrpcnwscu5.png) and [iOS](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/51fd2822eab8eae16e00000b-750.jpg).

Historically, these effects were difficult to implement on the web, requiring less than perfect [hacks or workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38145368/css-workaround-to-backdrop-filter). In recent years both [Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/3632/introducing-backdrop-filters/) and Edge have provided these capabilities through the `background-filter` property which dynamically blends foreground and background colors based on filter functions. Now Chrome does too, starting in version 76.

# Technical overview

CSS `backdrop-filter` applies one or more filters to the backdrop of an element, leaving the contents unchanged.

```css
.frosty-glass-pane {
  opacity: .9;
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}
```

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
  **Backdrop** - the painted content behind the element.
{% endAside %}

For `backdrop-filter` to have any effect, some portion of the overlaying element needs to be transparent. Therefore, overlaying elements without transparency will produce no effects.

  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/backdrop-filter/backdrop-filter.png" alt="2 comparisons where one is opaque and the other has transparency and therefore blurred translucency">
</figure>

Backdrop-filters are like CSS [filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter). When the property is not 'none', a new [stacking context](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/zindex.html) and/or [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) are created. Note, only elements with absolute and fixed position descendants will get a containing block.

### Summary
- The `backdrop-filter` property can apply one or more filters to an element.
- The overlaying element must be at least partially transparent.
- The overlaying element will get a new stacking context.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
`backdrop-filter` may harm performance.
{% endAside %}

## Essentials
All the favorite [filter functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter#Filter_functions) are present with `backdrop-filter`: blur(), brightness(), contrast(), opacity(), drop-shadow(), [etc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter). Combine them for rich and clever effects, or use just one filter for more subtle or precise effects. Even combine [SVG filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/filter) with these CSS filters!

In the following demo, the frosted effect is 2 part: color and blur. The blur is coming from `backdrop-filter`, while the tint is coming from the element's transparent background color. A frosted effect is the result of a blurred semi-transparent white backdrop.

### Single filter

```css
.blur-behind-me {
  backdrop-filter: blur(.5rem);
}
```

### Multiple filters
Sometimes multiple filters are needed to achieve the desired effect and CSS provides a way to do this. Works just by providing a list of filters separated by a space.

In the following demo, each of the 4 window panes have different combinations of backdrop filters applied while the same set of shapes are animated behind them. Can you spot the differences?

```css
.brighten-saturate-and-blur-behind-me {
  backdrop-filter: brightness(150%) saturate(150%) blur(1rem);
}
```

These essentials provide a sturdy foundation for creativity and performance. Design techniques and styles previously reserved for native operating systems are now performant and elegantly available in the browser with just a few additions to CSS. Very exciting!


## Creative examples
The web community is stellar at converting primitive features into sophisticated masterpieces. Backdrop filters have many incarnations of clever community samples. I find these demo's are best for teaching "what could be". Knowing the capabilities are there make me feel stronger.

Here are some interesting capabilities unlocked with `backdrop-filter`:

### Overlays

```css
.modal {
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

### Text contrast on dynamic backgrounds

```css
.background {
  filter: invert(1);
}

.foreground {
  backdrop-filter: invert(1);
}
```

## Conclusion
560+ of you all upvoted the [Chromium bug](https://crbug.com/497522) over the past few years, clearly marking this as a long awaited CSS feature. The wait is over! Chrome's excited to release `backdrop-filter` in 76.
